h1. Overview

The jQuery Easy Background Resize plugin is intended to easily allow a background image to dynamically resize itself to the size of the browser keeping the images aspect ratio in tact.

h2. Installation Instructions

First, make sure you have jQuery loaded within the <head> tag of your page.
	
@<script src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>@
@<script>google.load("jquery", "1");</script>@

Second, put the jQuery EZ Background Resize script in your <head> tag.
	
@<script src="javascripts/jquery.ez-bg-resize.js"></script>@

Third, simply put the image you want as your background image within a DIV tag anywhere in your page (preferably at the top under the <body> tag or ad the bottom before the </body> tag).  Be sure to name give your <div> tag an id attribute:
	
@<div id="the_background"><img src="images/some-image-somewhere.jpg"></div>@

And lastly, in your <head> tag, after the script call above add:
	
@<script>$(document).ready(function() { $("#the_background").ezBgResize(); });</script>@

And that's it.  You should have a background image that resides under your other content and resizes itself as the browser resizes.
